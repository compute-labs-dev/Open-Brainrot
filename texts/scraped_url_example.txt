• :us: Trump announces "Gold Card" program allowing foreigners to pay $5 million to enter US and create jobs.
President Donald Trump has announced a new immigration initiative called the "Gold Card" program, which will allow foreign nationals to pay $5 million for the right to work in the United States and establish a path to citizenship. According to Trump, this program would replace the existing EB-5 investor visa program, with the added requirement that Gold Card recipients would be vetted. Trump indicated the program would launch "in the next two weeks" and mentioned that "even Russian Oligarchs will be eligible for it," noting the program's purpose is to encourage foreigners to "enter US and create jobs."

• :flag-il: Israel-Hamas agree on prisoner exchange, maintaining fragile ceasefire that ended 15-month conflict.
Israeli and Hamas officials have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of deceased hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, preserving the fragile ceasefire that ended 15 months of conflict. According to AP News, the agreement resolves a deadlock that threatened to collapse the current six-week ceasefire, which was brokered by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar. The conflict began with Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack that killed approximately 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 hostages. Under the current ceasefire's first phase, Hamas is returning 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

• :us: SEC drops investigation against Uniswap Labs after extended probe into the DeFi protocol.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has concluded its investigation of Uniswap Labs without taking enforcement action against the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol developer. According to multiple sources including the Wall Street Journal, this decision ends a prolonged regulatory probe into Uniswap, one of the most prominent projects in the DeFi ecosystem. Cointelegraph characterized the development as a "huge win for DeFi" and suggested it might signal a broader shift in the SEC's approach to crypto enforcement under the Trump administration in 2025. The investigation's conclusion provides regulatory clarity for Uniswap Labs and potentially sets a precedent for how similar DeFi protocols might be treated by U.S. regulators.

• Bitcoin enters technical bear market, falling 20% from all-time high to under $88,000.
Bitcoin has entered what analysts define as a "technical bear market," dropping 20% from its all-time high and trading below $88,000 for the first time since November 2024. According to market data, this significant decline has triggered widespread concern in the cryptocurrency market, with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index falling to 25, indicating "extreme fear" among investors. Economic analyst Mohamed El-Erian noted the decline is occurring amid a "more general 'risk off' market sentiment," though he characterized it as "relatively mild." This 20% drawdown from recent highs represents Bitcoin's most substantial correction since its bull run began, and marks a psychological threshold that traditionally separates bull and bear market conditions.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally acknowledged Grayscale's filing to incorporate Ethereum staking capabilities into its spot Ethereum ETF product. This acknowledgment represents a procedural step in the regulatory review process for Grayscale's proposed enhancement to its existing Ethereum investment vehicle. If approved, this would allow the Grayscale Ethereum ETF to generate additional yield through staking rewards, potentially making it more attractive to investors seeking both exposure to Ethereum price movements and the passive income benefits of participating in the Ethereum network's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The SEC's acknowledgment does not guarantee approval but indicates the proposal has entered the formal review process.

:coin: Crypto/Web3 Analysis (Part 3/4)
The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive liquidation event with approximately $1.48 billion worth of positions wiped out in a 24-hour period, according to market monitoring sources. This substantial volume of forced closures of leveraged trading positions came amid Bitcoin's decline below $88,000 and broader market instability. The liquidation event primarily affected long positions (bets on price increases) as the market turned sharply downward, triggering automated margin calls across cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges. Such large-scale liquidation events typically exacerbate market moves by forcing additional selling pressure as positions are automatically closed, potentially creating a cascading effect across the cryptocurrency market.

• :us: US spot Bitcoin ETFs record largest-ever daily outflow of $938 million.
U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their largest-ever single-day outflow of approximately $938 million on February 25, 2025, according to market data. This record withdrawal comes amid Bitcoin's broader price decline, with Cointelegraph reporting that these investment vehicles have experienced more than $2.4 billion in net outflows throughout February. CoinDesk analysis suggests that the rising yields on 10-year Treasury notes are diminishing the appeal of Bitcoin "carry trades," where investors borrow at lower interest rates to invest in assets expected to yield higher returns. The significant outflow indicates a potential shift in institutional sentiment toward Bitcoin as traditional fixed-income investments become more attractive in the current interest rate environment.

Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has issued a warning about hackers creating fraudulent GitHub repositories designed to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting users. According to Kaspersky's report, these attackers are operating a campaign dubbed "GitVenom" that has been active for at least two years and targets users by creating convincing fake GitHub projects that appear to be legitimate tools such as Telegram Bitcoin wallet management bots or computer game utilities. The malicious code embedded in these repositories can steal passwords, cryptocurrency wallet information, and hijack Bitcoin transaction addresses. Kaspersky documented at least one victim who lost 5 Bitcoin (approximately $442,000 at the time) to this attack in November. The security firm noted that while this campaign primarily affects users in Russia, Brazil, and Turkey, it continues to spread globally.
